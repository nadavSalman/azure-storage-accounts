2.        Create an ARM (Azure Resource Manager) template for storage account and create 2 storage accounts

3.        Create an ARM template for a Windows or Linux server

4.        Create a tool to deploy the Storage accounts and the server in a continuous manner. Any type of CD (Continues deployment)  pipe can be used here, preferred is an Azure DevOps pipe (In order to bypass permissions, set your personal computer as Azure DevOps agent)

5.        Write a script that will create, upload, and copy 100 blobs from Storage account A to B, execute it on the server you created earlier using CD pipeline.

6.        Choose metrics to monitor that small system of 1 server and 2 storage accounts   and create dashboard via "Monitor" to show that
